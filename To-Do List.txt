On donation page, maybe have it like services where each image kicks off another modal?

Gap on right hand side of modal is itt not scrolling - could just make the page scrollable each time as a hack?

Opening Days and hours need to to prominant, maybe have something on page the whole time?
Formatting of donations/fundraising section, homepage section and modal section

Need to sort out the "meet the OTR team" section where the hover puts up a colour and text etc, need to just have name of person and position in OTR.

Need to sort out links at bottom of site.

Device responsive:
 - Menu wording on top needs changing (maybe small menu earlier (easy/quick fix)
 - Need a different intro to wider screens as carosel gets messed up

Map on site:
- Showing location:
- Also one showing area we can help, funding area.

The readme text/button on intial carosel maybe better being like the ebig version (slide 4?) or maybe that one is too big??
Donate link images need to be sized via CSS rather than HTML.

--------------------------------------------------------
Need to use media thing'es to make the site properly responsive with text sizes etc
Need to make sure media thing'es are sensitive enough for a decent percentage of devices
Alts for all images
Fundraising toolkit needs a download link on fundraising page

The "more information section", Sex and relationships, lists need to have title of list and bullet points closed up.

Is this an issue?
